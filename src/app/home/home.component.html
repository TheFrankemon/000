    <p>
      A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space. Think about all the fucking possibilities. Be fucking bold. Greatness isn’t the height of your stature, it’s the heft of your spirit. Saul Bass on failure: Failure is built into creativity… the creative act involves this element of ‘newness’ and ‘experimentalism,’ then one must expect and accept the fucking possibility of failure. Respect your fucking craft. Never let your guard down by thinking you’re fucking good enough. Don’t fucking quit. Even with the odds against you, time is against the odds. Celebrate your fucking failures. Then you’ll prove to yourself that you can survive anything. Practice won’t get you anywhere if you mindlessly fucking practice the same thing. Change only occurs when you work deliberately with purpose toward a goal. When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother? To surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are told you don’t have it in you to succeed. You are not your fucking work.
